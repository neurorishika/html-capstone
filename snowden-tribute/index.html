      <p><b>Edward Snowden</b> is a former National Security Agency subcontractor who made headlines in 2013 when he leaked top secret information about NSA surveillance activities.<br><br> Born in North Carolina in 1983, Edward Snowden later worked for the National Security Agency through subcontractor Booz Allen in the organization's Oahu office. During his time there, Snowden collected top-secret documents regarding NSA domestic surveillance practices that he found disturbing. After Snowden fled to Hong Kong, China and met with journalists from <b>The Guardian</b> and filmmaker Laura Poitras, newspapers began printing the documents that he had leaked, many of them detailing the monitoring of American citizens. The U.S. has charged Snowden with violations of the Espionage Act while many groups call him a hero. Snowden has found asylum in Russia and continues to speak about his work. <br></p>

 <h1>Timeline:</h1>
 <ul>
   <li><b>June 21, 1983:</b> Edward Joseph Snowden is born in Elizabeth City, N.C. He spends his early life there before moving with his parents, Lonnie, a Coast Guard officer, and Elizabeth, known as Wendy, to Maryland.</li>
   <li><b>1991-1998:</b> Snowden attends public schools in Anne Arundel County, south of Baltimore, before dropping out of high school in his sophomore year.</li>
   <li><b>1999-2001:</b> During this period he developed a fascination with computers and technology and socialized with a tight circle of friends who were similarly enamored of the Internet and Japanese anime culture. He also registered on the Ars Technica website, a hacking and technology forum, and over a two-year period posted as “The One True Hooha” or just “Hooha” about role-playing video games. After his parents’ divorce in 2001, Snowden lived with his mother in Ellicott City, Md.</li>
   <li><b>2002-2004:</b> After attending a local community college off and on, Snowden passes a General Educational Development test to receive a high school equivalency credential. In March 2004, he enlists in an Army Reserve Special Forces training program to “fight to help free people from oppression” in Iraq. But he says he broke his legs in a training accident, and Army records show he was discharged in September. He then lands a job as a security guard at the Center for Advanced Study of Language at the University of Maryland, which has a close relationship with the National Security Agency.</li>
   <li><b>2006:</b> Snowden is hired by the CIA as a technical/IT expert and receives a top-secret clearance.</li>
   <li><b>2007-2009:</b> Snowden is posted to Geneva, Switzerland, under diplomatic cover as an IT and cyber security expert for the CIA, a position that gives him access to a wide array of classified documents. During this period he became disillusioned “about how my government functions and what its impact is in the world. I realized that I was part of something that was doing far more harm than good."</li>
   <li><b>Late 2009-March 2012:</b> Snowden’s supervisor at the CIA placed a critical assessment of his behavior and work habits in his personnel file and voiced the suspicion that he had tried to “break into classified computer files to which he was not authorized to have access,” after he is identified as the leaker, two unnamed “senior American officials.” Snowden leaves the CIA soon after his supervisor’s criticism and begins work as a NSA contractor assigned by Dell -- one of 854,000 contractors with top-secret clearance working for the federal government. Over the next several years, he switches between assignments with the NSA and CIA for Dell, including a stint at a NSA facility in Japan that lasts until March 2012.</li>
   <li><b>March 2012:</b> Snowden moves to Hawaii to work at a NSA facility there as a Dell employee. He moves into a blue-and-white house in Waipahu, where he is joined by his girlfriend, Lindsay Mills, a 28-year-old performance artist. He donates $250 to the Republican presidential campaign of libertarian Ron Paul, campaign records show, followed by a second contribution of the same amount two months later.</li>

He donates $250 to the Republican presidential campaign of libertarian Ron Paul, campaign records show, followed by a second contribution of the same amount two months later.</li>
   <li><b>Dec. 1, 2012:</b> Snowden reaches out to Glenn Greenwald, a lawyer and columnist for The Guardian.</li>
   <li><b>Jan. 2013:</b> Snowden reaches out to Laura Poitras, a documentary filmmaker.</li>
   <li><b>March 2013:</b> He seeks a new contractor job with Booz Allen Hamilton at the same NSA facility in Hawaii. He did so to get additional access to classified documents he intends to leak.</li>
   <li><b>May 2013:</b> Snowden begins sending some documents to Poitras, Greenwald and to Barton Gellman of the Washington Post. He tells his NSA supervisor that he needs to take some time off to undergo treatment for epilepsy, which he was diagnosed with the previous year, according to the Guardian. He tells his girlfriend he will be away for a few weeks, but is vague about the reason.</li>
   <li><b>May 20, 2013:</b> Snowden arrives in Hong Kong from Hawaii.</li>
   <li><b>June 2, 2013:</b> Greenwald and Poitras arrive in Hong Kong.</li>
   <li><b>June 5, 2013:</b> First revelations arising from the documents provided by Snowden are published in a Guardian article about the NSA’s collection of domestic email and telephone metadata from Verizon as part of what is later revealed to be an even broader collection effort.</li>
   <li><b>June 6, 2013:</b> The Guardian and the Washington Post each publish an article about the NSA program PRISM, which forces biggest US internet companies to hand over data on domestic users.</li>
   <li><b>June 9, 2013:</b> The Guardian reveals Edward Snowden as the source of the NSA leaks.</li>
   <li><b>June 11, 2013:</b> Snowden is fired by Booz Allen Hamilton. In a statement, the company says, “News reports that this individual has claimed to have leaked classified information are shocking, and if accurate, this action represents a grave violation of the code of conduct and core values of our firm.”</li>
   <li><b>June 14, 2013:</b> The U.S. Justice Department charges Snowden with theft, “unauthorized communication of national defense information” and “willful communication of classified communications intelligence information to an unauthorized person” – the latter two charges violations of the 1917 Espionage Act. The criminal complaint is initially filed under seal in the Eastern District of Virginia, and unsealed a week later.</li>
   <li><b>June 23, 2013:</b> Snowden leaves Hong Kong for Ecuador, with a planned stopover in Russia. But he is stranded at Sheremetyevo International Airport in Moscow after U.S. authorities rescind his passport. He spends the next month living in limbo in the airport’s transit center.</li>
   <li><b>Aug. 1, 2013:</b> He is granted temporary asylum by Russian authorities as they consider his application for permanent political asylum.</li>
