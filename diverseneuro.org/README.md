# A comprehensive project about Inclusivity in Neuroscience
## Does interdisciplinarity translate into intersectionality? Letâ€™s look at what the data has to say.

#### Why this project?
As scientists, we are trained to overlook the personal and subjective and optimise the achievable objectivity in our work. Our fundamental dogma, so to speak, preaches unbiased analysis and aims to remove the observer from the observed. In giving ourselves completely over to this practice, we sometimes cannot come to terms with the harsh reality of the non-theoretical: We are people.

#### Why Neuroscience?
Propelled by the tenets of machine learning and artificial intelligence, neuroscience is easily one of the fastest-growing disciplines in STEM. Few disciplines enjoy the truly interdisciplinary status that neuroscience does. A brilliant confluence of a large number of disciplines, ranging from statistical mechanics to theory of mind to cognition and biology to information theory, Neuroscience thrives on its interdisciplinarity.

Several parent disciplines of the field, particularly those under Physics and Mathematics, have long been stereotypically perceived as 'male domains', while most women in science are found in disciplines such as psychology and life sciences, commonly perceived as the 'softer sciences'. Studies have shown that the former disciplines prove to be more hostile to minority groups such as LGBTQIA+, whereas fields with a larger representation of women are safer spaces [11,12,13]. While in recent times there have been more inquiries into the representation of women in STEM, data about minority demographics such as LGBTQIA+ in STEM have been as sparse as the representation itself.

#### How will studying this help?
With our study, we aim to understand the extent of inclusivity in an emergent intersectional community such as neuroscience (including the AI and cognitive psychology communities), a community that we ourselves belong to. We believe that the Neurosciences community is fertile ground not only to sample from, but to also propel early proactive course-correcting if necessary. As people of Science, it is essential that we understand any biases or perceived threats to inclusivity, so that we can move to combat inequality and discrimination. Let data lead the way.
